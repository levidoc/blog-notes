# Overall Goal
Create a lite version of a blogging website. This should utilise public platforms like github to host the webpages. The overall task is to create a blogging system that uses external sources to store the blog data. 
> Just Self Host Your Blogs
> Will Also Provide some free external api's for kiddle script users.

# Project Breakdown
The Bin folder will contain all the non front-end files. These will have both the server side code and user end code. 

## External_source Scripts 
The scripts located on the bin/external_source.php have the basic CRUD features for communication with any external API through CURL. This will be used to handle the safe data transfer. The transfer of data will occur in pair|key relationship. This will make using multiple api's easy. 
Replace The API endpoint with the ones that you would configure for your blog.
